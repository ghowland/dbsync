# Zones and their Database Sets
# 
# A Zone is a like an "area of work", in that a different set of work is done in that
#   zone, and likely it is access by different people, for different purposes.
#   Consider the difference between a Developer, Staging and Production zones.
#   The Developer zone is used by developers and testers on new features.  The
#   Staging zone is used by testers to look for problems before moving to production.
#   The Production zone will be used by end-users.
#
# Database sets is just a way to combine more than one working set of databases
#   to be synced inside a zone.  For instance, in a Production zone there could
#   be end-user databases and internal tool databases.  These should be tracked
#   and synced separately, but they are still both in the Production zone.
